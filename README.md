# Alarm Microservice (Go + Gin)

This is a simple microservice built using Go and the Gin framework. It manages alarms with basic CRUD operations and notifies if certain conditions are met. The data is stored in memory (no database).

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or above).
2. Clone the repo and navigate to the folder.
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.
